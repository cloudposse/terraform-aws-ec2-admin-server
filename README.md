# terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform Module for providing a server capable of running admin tasks. Use `terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server` to create and manage an admin instance.

## Usage

Note: add `${var.ssh_key_pair}` private key to the `ssh agent`.

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```terraform
module "admin_tier" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server.git?ref=master"
  ssh_key_pair                = "${var.ssh_key_pair}"
  github_api_token            = "${var.github_api_token}"
  github_organization         = "${var.github_organization}"
  github_team                 = "${var.github_team}"
  instance_type               = "${var.instance_type}"
  vpc_id                      = "${var.vpc_id}"
  name                        = "admin"
  namespace                   = "${var.namespace}"
  stage                       = "${var.stage}"
  subnets                     = ["${var.subnets}"]
  zone_id                     = "${module.terraform-aws-route53-cluster-zone.zone_id}"
  security_groups             = ["${var.security_groups}"]
  allow_cidr_blocks           = ["${var.allow_cidr_blocks}"]
}

```

### Module `terraform-aws-route53-cluster-zone`

Module `terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server` requires another module to be used additionally - `terraform-aws-route53-cluster-zone`.

`terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server` uses `terraform-aws-route53-cluster-hostname` to create a DNS record for created host. `terraform-aws-route53-cluster-hostname` module needs `zone_id` parameter as an input, and this parameter actually is an output from `terraform-aws-route53-cluster-zone`.

That is why `terraform-aws-route53-cluster-zone` should be implemented in `root` TF manifest when we need `terraform-aws-ec2-admin-server`.


### This module depends on the next modules:

* [terraform-null-label](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-null-label)
* [terraform-aws-ubuntu-github-authorized-keys-user-data](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-ubuntu-github-authorized-keys-user-data)
* [terraform-aws-route53-cluster-hostname](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-route53-cluster-hostname)
* [terraform-aws-route53-cluster-zone](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-route53-cluster-zone) (not directly, but `terraform-aws-route53-cluster-hostname` need child `zone_id`)

It is necessary to run `terraform get` to download those modules.

Now reference the label when creating an instance (for example):
```terraform
resource "aws_ami_from_instance" "example" {
  name               = "terraform-example"
  source_instance_id = "${module.admin_tier.id}"
}
```
